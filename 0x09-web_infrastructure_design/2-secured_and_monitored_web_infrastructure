## Answer:
	1. We added firewalls to control traffic and for better security.
        We also added monitoring tools, that will monitor our application and
        also our server for a better performance and data collector.
        2. Firewalls are software or hardware that prevent unauthorized access
        to a network.It checks the coming and going data, based on predefined
        rules. If that data abides by the rules then it will be allowed to
        enter.
        3. HTTPS is a secure form of HTTP. It uses data encryption to transfer
        data from one to another. When HTTPS request is sent, public key with
        SSL certification are sent back from the server. The client does SSL
        handshake, which means the client also shows it credentials that
        matches the SSL certificate. This then allows the data to be decrypted
        in the clients machine. 
        4. Monitoring tools are used to collect data about, what is going on
        and how it's perfomance is, when it comes to application and/or server.
        The data also shows any abnormalities that is making performance lower.
        This data is then used to fix the problem that is being repeated.
        It will make fixing easier because the data will lead you to the area
        where you need to focus to fix it.
        5. Data is constantly collected when an application or a server is
        doing it's job. It's performance, availability, user experiences are
        constantly being monitored. This data will then be changed to readable
	form. So If there is a glitch it will be caught immediately and dealt 
	with.
        6. We first set up monitoring tools. This tools are able to monitor 
	metrics. When they do so, the can monitor the quieres per second, to 
	see if it can handle the traffic and if it is scalable enough for the 
	incoming traffic.

## Issues with the infrastructure:
        1. If one applies for SSL termination it will affect sensitive data
        while making transactions because transaction should be made in a
        secured connection.
        2. Any changes that this Master makes the all the changes will also be
        replicated on the slave, data can be lost easily.
        3. The problem is failure in that server will fail all of these
        components.
